          I made this app to add challenge and variety for days when I feel
          stagnant and stuck between routes that are either too easy or too
          diffcult. The goal is to fill the void in that gap of difficulty.

          Tap the "Draw" button to draw a new challenge or helper card.

          Some example rulesets:

            <li className="mt-1">
              Draw a card, attempt the most difficult route you can with the
              drawn cards, repeat until failure.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-1">
              Only choose to do the last card and consider the previous ones as
              "burned".
            </li>
            <li className="mt-1">
              Alternate with a friend after each draw akin to a game of
              H-O-R-S-E.

            <li className="mt-1">
              Draw a few cards, choose one or more to perform on a route and
              discard if you succeed. Repeat until your hand is empty.
