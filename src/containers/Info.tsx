          I made this app to add challenge and variety for days when I feel
          stagnant and stuck between routes that are either too easy or too
          diffcult. The goal is to fill the void in that gap of difficulty.

          I'm not an advanced climber and your variation in skill and anatomy
          will definitely result in a different experience than mine which I
          would love to hear about if you care to share:{" "}

          This app is a small personal side project along others that I only
          occassionaly get time to work on so excuse the jank. This app is
          mainly designed to be used on a mobile device.

          Tap the "Draw" button to draw a new challenge card. The number at the
          corner of the card is the tier of the card. The higher the tier, the
          lower the chances of it being drawn. Afterwards, it's up to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some example rulesets:
          <ul className="list-outside list-disc pl-8">
            <li className="mt-1">
              Draw a card, complete the most difficult route you are able to
              with the drawn cards, repeat until failiure.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-1">
              Only choose to do the last card and consider the previous ones as
              "burned".
            </li>
            <li className="mt-1">
              Alternate with a friend after each draw akin to a game of
              H-O-R-S-E.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-1">
              Draw a few cards, choose one to perform and discard, as you repeat
              and empty your entier hand.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          To disable/enable cards, open the "Modify Deck" window by clicking the
          cards{" "}

          button at the top of the screen.

        <p>
          To switch change visuals from cards to a list for better readability,
          click the list{" "}
